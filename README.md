Testing my knowledge on creating an application website by seeing the final form of the site and trying to mimic the same CSS properties.
> (Following the same theme and CSS property of one of the courses I'm followings "[The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp By Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)")

Declaration! This was a skeleton project, meaning that all the HTML elements were provided and all I did is use my CSS knowledge to transform it from a pure HTML page with no styling whatsoever.
